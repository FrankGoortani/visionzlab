# AGENT Instructions

This repository contains a static website built with HTML and CSS. Source files live at the root as well as inside `components/` for reusable snippets and `public/` for assets.

## Coding Style
- Indent using **two spaces**; do not use tabs.
- Keep line length under **120 characters** when possible.
- File and directory names should use **kebab-case**.
- Place all images and icons in the `public/` folder.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Avoid committing the `node_modules/` directory or other generated files.
- Keep commits small and descriptive.
- When adding components or pages, update the main HTML and accompanying CSS.

## Testing / Build
There are currently no automated tests or build scripts. If you add a build step (for example using Parcel) or other checks in the future, run them locally before committing.
